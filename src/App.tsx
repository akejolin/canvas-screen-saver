          Leading a team is about carefully listen to the team members, putting the trust to them, their skills, their knowledge and give them space to contribute. Then you point a direction.

      <span className="category-title">Most important when practice SCRUM:</span><br/>
      What i think is absolutely most important when practice <K>SCRUM</K> is to work <K>close to the production</K> environment. If you are comfortable and do truly know how
      the production environment works and how it is set up, you will be able to solve problems faster, see the solutions faster, be more confidence
      to take quicker and correct decisions. Close to production also means you need to have <K>continuous integration</K> in place. You need to run short
      iteration loops and have very simple and fast pipelines .
      <br/>
      All that comes together with the result of less <K>Time To Market (TTM)</K> and less stressful situations for the team members.

          A major project for my team during the first half year of 2020. My main participation of this project
          was to move and deal with all <K>frontend application</K>. Before we could do the move, the existing apps needed to
          be adjusted and <K>dockerized</K>. They needed to be configurated and migrated to fit the cloud and the <K>Kubernetes clusters</K>.
          <br/><br/>Another part of the project was to <K>onboard</K> the teams with all the new tools and
          features that came along with this cloud solution. But we also needed to deal with this major <K>culture change</K> this
          migration evoked when going towards a true <K>micro service</K> architecture.

          <span className="category-title">Description:</span>
          The main target and goal with this project was to decouple the frontend web layer
          and set it free from the backend. The idea was that the frontend web layer should
          completely get its data via <K>REST APIs</K>, in the same way the native apps did.
          To do that we needed to rebuild the frontend layer from scratch and turn it
          from being based on <K>C-code</K> to be based on <K>Node</K> and <K>javascript</K>. We also wanted to merge
          the mobile web app and the desktop app to be one with features such <K>responsive design</K>.

          We built the web app with framework such <K>react</K>, <K>redux</K> and <K>webpack</K> etc.

          <span className="category-title">Description:</span>
          I wanted to build a game to inspire my kids to start coding and during a hackday I did
          the classical game asteroids. The game is based on the <K>canvas</K> element
          with frame based animation. I used <K>React</K> to structure the app and
          added <K>Redux</K> to provide data across the application. The sounds are recorded by me.
          <br/>
          Later on I <K>dockerized</K> the app and let the it be served via <K>http2</K> protocol.
          Then the bundling became more unnecessary and i therefore converted the app to be based on <K>snowpack</K>.
